# SilkeBoard by „Silkė“
## What is it?
It is a collaborative platform with an emphasis on numbers and ideas that are difficult to represent in text.
Create a group to which you can invite your friends, peers and coworkers and collaborate using the chat, whiteboard and a wide variety of calculators!
## What can it do?
Without an account you can explore some of our features. However, you won't be able to use any collaborative features. For that you will need an account.

### Profile
You can create an account by accessing the [sign up page](client/src/pages/SignUpPage.tsx) from the [landing page](client/src/pages/LandingPage.tsx)
![Sign up page](https://github.com/EggsDuty/SilkeProject/assets/113368248/f702036e-4f27-422a-b578-1eaa5dc4dfe9)

You can then customize it by adding a picture and description. Here you are also able to change your nickname to another one.
![Profile page](https://github.com/EggsDuty/SilkeProject/assets/113368248/bc895c10-8715-47ed-9fbd-ef53a9cca7d0)

Here you will also find the ability to send and accept friend requests. You can also remove a friend from this page.
Your password can also be changed here.

### Groups
Once you've got your account setup, you can head over to the [groups page](client/src/pages/AllGroupsPage.tsx).
From here you can view all the groups that you are a part of, accept group invites and even create your own!
![Groups page](https://github.com/EggsDuty/SilkeProject/assets/113368248/537847e8-e423-4e44-b794-b9dc5a974edb)

After selecting a specific group, you will be taken to that groups' page.
![Group page](https://github.com/EggsDuty/SilkeProject/assets/113368248/9feb3c2d-1fa4-4fa5-afd8-6d173dffff23)
![Chat](https://github.com/EggsDuty/SilkeProject/assets/113368248/d04bcc8f-fdd4-45a7-85f4-e2b85a4639d6)

Here you can see all of the group members and a calendar, and below them there is a chat.

**Calendar**<br/>
The calendar allows you to plan events with your group.
You can:
* Create an event
* View events made by other members
* Edit an event
* Delete an event

**Chat**<br/>
The chat allows for basic communication between you and your members.
You can:
* Send messages
* Receive messages from others

Finally, you can access your group's whiteboard by clicking a button.
<hr/>

### Whiteboard
The [whiteboard](client/src/pages/WhiteBoard.tsx) is shared by all members of a group. Meaning, that if you start drawing something, other members will immediately be able to see it!

> [!NOTE]
> The whiteboard was made using the [tldraw](https://tldraw.dev) library.
<br/>

From the sidebar you can drag calculators onto the whiteboard to ease calculations.
